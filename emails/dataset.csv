Why wait until you're dead? I'm sure there's enough carbon in the fat from your typical liposuction job to make a decent diamond. - Joe http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork",0,53e0859a-00be-4870-a1d9-6d7912732c41
1519,Jim Whitehead <ejw@cse.ucsc.edu>,How unlucky can you get?,"So, last night around 5:30AM I'm woken up by a loud *craaack*, followed by one of the most dreaded sounds a homeowner ever hears: vast quantities of water spilling onto the floor. The water is coming from the bathroom, the toilet specifically. Turns out the water cistern on the top of the toilet had cracked down the side, and was spilling out all the water. So, after shutting off the water and mopping up, I was left to ponder what are the odds of having mechanical failure of a large rectangular porcelain bowl, in the absence of any visible stressors (like someone striking it with a sledgehammer)? We hadn't done anything unusual to the toilet in the recent past -- just normal use. I've *never* heard of this happening to anyone I know. The guts, yeah, they fail all the time. But the storage bowl -- never. Geesh. - Jim http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork",0,2909fe9f-9b43-455e-9511-8d55b81d2349
